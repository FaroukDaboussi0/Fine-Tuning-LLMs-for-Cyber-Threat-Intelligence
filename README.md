# Cyber Threat Intelligence with LLaMA3

## Overview
This project fine-tunes LLaMA 3 7b for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and evaluates it using [CTIBench](CTIBench%20Paper.pdf)
 .

### Steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather CTI data.
2. **Fine-Tuning:** Adapt LLaMA for CTI.
3. **Evaluation:** Test with CTIBench.
4. **Analysis:** Review model performance.



## Setup

1. **Clone & Install:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FaroukDaboussi0/Fine-Tuning-LLMs-for-Cyber-Threat-Intelligence.git
    cd CTI_expert
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    - **Google API Token:** Export your Google API token using the following command:

      ```bash
      export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_google_api_token'
      ```

    - **Hugging Face Token:** Export your Hugging Face token using the following command:

      ```bash
      export HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN='your_huggingface_token'
      ```


## Usage:
To generate text using the LLaMA 7B model fine-tuned for CTI tasks, use the following code:

```python
from Models.llama_7b_qlora_CTI import generate_text_with_llama_CTI

prompt = "Explain ransomware's impact on security."
generated_text = generate_text_with_llama(prompt)
print(generated_text)
```
